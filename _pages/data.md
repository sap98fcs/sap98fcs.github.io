**The ANTIELAB Research Data Archive 反修例運動研究數據庫**
[https://antielabdata.jmsc.hku.hk](https://antielabdata.jmsc.hku.hk)

Led by Professor King-wa Fu from the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, our team collected a few hundred thousand messages from Telegram, a widely adopted social media channel during the 2019 Hong Kong protests, and other data to compile this data archive, which contains a detailed timeline, mapping of teargas  and mobilization, a poster search engine, relevant statistics, and a glossary. The data is available upon request.
