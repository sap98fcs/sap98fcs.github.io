I am a member of The Global Research Association of Politics in Hong Kong (GRAPH) [GRAPH](https://graph-hk.github.io/web/), an international research network for academic researchers studying Hong Kong. We provide a platform to connect those who are interested in Hong Kong politics. We also organize online talks and academic conferences.

To receive information about our upcoming talks, please subscribe to our mailing list [mailing list](https://forms.gle/L85raaDrjX3suitM9) and follow us on Twitter [X](https://twitter.com/GRAPHhk)!

See more information about the background and goals of GRAPH here [Intro](https://graph-hk.github.io/web/about/).
