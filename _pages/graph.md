I am a member of The Global Research Association of Politics in Hong Kong [(GRAPH)](https://graph-hk.github.io/web/), an international research network for academic researchers studying Hong Kong. We provide a platform to connect those who are interested in Hong Kong politics. We also organize online talks and academic conferences.

To receive information about our upcoming talks, please subscribe to our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/L85raaDrjX3suitM9) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GRAPHhk)!

See more information about the background and goals of GRAPH [here](https://graph-hk.github.io/web/about/).
